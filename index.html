                    <p>The most common algorithmic trading strategies follow trends in moving averages, channel breakouts, price level movements, and related technical indicators. These are the easiest and simplest strategies to implement through algorithmic trading because these strategies do not involve making any predictions or price forecasts. Trades are initiated based on the occurrence of desirable trends, which are easy and straightforward to implement through algorithms without getting into the complexity of predictive analysis. Using 50- and 200-day moving averages is a popular trend-following strategy.</p>

                    <p>Mean reversion in trading theorizes that prices tend to return to average levels, and extreme price moves are hard to sustain for extended periods. Traders who partake in mean reversion trading have developed many methods for capitalising on the theory. In all cases, they are betting that an extreme level — whether it be volatility, price, growth, or a technical indicator — will return to the average.</p>

                <div class= "ex" id="ex3">
                    <p>Index funds have defined periods of rebalancing to bring their holdings to par with their respective benchmark indices. This creates profitable opportunities for algorithmic traders, who capitalize on expected trades that offer 20 to 80 basis points profits depending on the number of stocks in the index fund just before index fund rebalancing. Such trades are initiated via algorithmic trading systems for timely execution and the best prices.</p>

                    <p>Proven mathematical models, like the delta-neutral trading strategy, allow trading on a combination of options and the underlying security. (Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy consisting of multiple positions with offsetting positive and negative deltas—a ratio comparing the change in the price of an asset, usually a marketable security, to the corresponding change in the price of its derivative—so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals zero.)</p>
